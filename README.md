# Graduation_program

These codes were made for my thesis in The university of Tokyo.
The thesis dealed with the process of specialization in STS(Science and Technology Studies) field by applying citation network analysis and text embedding to STS papers.
Here are codes for

- overviewing the collected STS papers   (--> [Basic_Info](https://github.com/HirokiMiyabe/Graduation_program/tree/main/Basic_Info))
- clustering the citation network by dendrogram.(--> [Hieralchy_Clustering](https://github.com/HirokiMiyabe/Graduation_program/tree/main/Hieralchy_Clustering))
- embedding the papers and clustering them(--> [embedding_results](https://github.com/HirokiMiyabe/Graduation_program/tree/main/embedding_results))
- plotting the number of authors overlapped among journals(--> [OverLapping_Authors](https://github.com/HirokiMiyabe/Graduation_program/tree/main/OverLapping_Authors))
